# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

### Future ideas:

1. The image of coffee shop in the header of the page has background which is visible when we changing width of viewport. I'm not sure for now if it's possible to solve that issue with using some styles to this image but i have an idea to delete background using Photoshop.
2. Create an infinite animation to the header logo for the arcs which will rotate in a circle hiding in the second half of the circle.
3. Instead of 'o' in header title- Specialty coffee we can add coffee bean with steam animation above it.
